# IIS_Log_Parser
log parser for IIS logs


Please see the comments and variables in the Powershell script which have to be set to be successfull with this script.

I can be used as a scheduled task to run on servers to deliver a mail to the admins mailbox.
The content of the mail is adjusted by the error codes to collect from the actual log and the their description in the mailbody.


Use a translator if needed to understand/adjust the German comments.
